# SimulationManager

The SimulationManager tracks egos, sensors, annotations, and metrics, combining them into a unified [JSON-based dataset](Schema/Synthetic_Dataset_Schema.md) on disk. While sensors are registered, the SimulationManager ensures that frames are deterministic and run at the appropriate simulation times to let each sensor run at its own rate.

## Sensor scheduling

## Custom annotations and metrics
